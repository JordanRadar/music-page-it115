      <p>(Add Transition). Music is so powerful and delightful to us that when we listen to a song we like and associate positive memories with, our brains instantly release dopamine throughout the body (The University of Arizona, 2017). This renowned “feel-good” neurotransmitter shouldn’t be taken lightly however, as it plays a key role in prompting motivation or even giving you the ability to move your body (Perry, 2015).</p>
      <p>Understandably, many students connect homework and study-time with negative emotions. To aid this, de-stressing tactics have skyrocketed as more people are moving towards lifestyles that not only protect their physical health, but their mental health as well. The most common and universal relaxation method is listening to music. The interactions taking place in your brain when listening to a particular song you like can help you focus better (Florida National University, 2019; Raypole, 2020). This is because the parts of your brain that are engaged when hearing a song you like are the same parts that light up when you attempt to memorize, predict, or pay close attention to something.</p>
      <p>In a recent study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were performed on 21 participants to examine the effects of familiar and likeable music versus unpleasurable music on a person. Not only does music impact the analytical area of your mind, but the study found that music influences the default mode network circuit (DMNC); participants DMNC were more connected when listening to what they enjoyed, and when they listened to songs they didn’t like, the DMNC’s connection was not as strong (Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, 2017).</p>
      <p>By making it a habit to incorporate music during study hours, you are building critical connections in your brain that will refine your productivity as well as your imagination. Listening to songs that coincide with the feeling you are trying to produce has a greater impact on one than listening for the lyrics.</p>
      <h2>Tips:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li> Diversify your playlist. Listening to songs you already know can cause you to become distracted. </li>
          <li> Opt for sounds that you can pull energy from. Music that evokes great amounts of negative or positive emotions can also be a source of prolonged downtime. </li>
          <li> Listen to instrumentals to reduce the urge to sing along </li>
        </ol>

      <p>As the saying goes, “music is life itself”, so remember: it's not a requirement to choose readily-made playlists, choose what you connect to. Have fun and align your picks with what makes you feel the best!</p>
