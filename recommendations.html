            Here are some recommendations from the authors of this website. Hopefully you've learned something and now understand why music is so helpful when getting stuff done!

            <h3>Yodet Shigute</h2>
            <p>
                When I study I love to listen to lofi hiphop! I also enjoy playing Christmas jazz. I associate good memories with the holiday so it gives a comforting ambience, which eases the feelings of anxiety before taking on loads of work. If I am feeling unmotivated to study I will play upbeat Ethiopian jazz music or even switch out music for white noise or rain sounds. 
                <br>

            <h3>Tewelde Abraha</h3>
            <p>
                Instrumental albums and/or playlist by renowned hip-hop producers. The funky samples, deep drums and kicks, and gritty sound puts me in a trance. 
                Notable producers, albums, and playlists I've currently had in rotation:

            <h3>Jordan Radnich</h3>
            <p>
                Like my colleagues, I tend to go for more instrumental tunes. Albums without lyrics, instrumentals, video game music, vaporwave, or future bass/future funk. I also listen to music in other languages, because I'm not nearly fluent enough to be distracted by the lyrics in most cases. I could honestly go on for a whole page about the genres of music I listen to, but it really depends on what mood I'm in. When studying, specifically, I listen to extended playlists or 24hr streams of just instrumental music. I hope you like the things I've recommended below!

            <h2>Nonspecific Recommendations</h2> 

            <h3>Classical Music</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some research still suggests that classical music can help people learn and focus (just not as impressive as the 1990s would have you believe). For example, one study found that college students who listened to classical music during lectures learned more than those who listened to the same lecture without classical music. Some research suggests, however, that classical (or any type of complex) music is best when performing simple tasks, rather than complicated ones.</li>
                </ul>  

            <h3> Ambient music </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Ambient music often lacks a true beat, usually doesn't have lyrics, and ends up blending into the preexisting background noise. In terms of focus and productivity, one study found that white noise can help people with ADHD ignore noisy environments and perform tasks with more efficiency.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3> Nature sounds </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Boosts your mood and promotes deep focus.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3> Epic Music </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Epic music can make you feel like you're doing something grandiose to change the world. Think trailer music for adventure and action movies. It empowers and lifts you up.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3> Video Game Music </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Music from video games is a great choice because the compositions are specifically designed to enhance your gaming experience.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3> Others we'd like to mention </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Meditation music </li>
                    <li> Blues </li>
                    <li> Jazz </li>
